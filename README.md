# C4 Deployment Rollback Exercise Incident Report

## Purpose
Our Deployment posed an interesting challenge of simulating a scenario where we would essentially need to use version control to rollback an issue we had with a URL shortener tool. 

**Background**

We have an SLA with Nike to provide them access to our URL shortener. In the SLA, we are only allowed 20 minutes of downtime a year. If anything happens to the URL shortener, we must communicate any incidents to Nike.

### Nike's Use Case
- Nike uses special URLs called "launch pages" or "product pages" for new sneaker releases.
- These URLs are promoted through various channels such as website, social media, and email lists.
- Special functionalities like countdown timers and lottery systems are often involved in these pages.

**Resources Nike Uses**
- Website
- Social Media
- Email List

#### Additional Notes
Special URLs can:
1. Create a sense of exclusivity
2. Track customer behavior
3. Create a seamless customer experience

## Issues
One of the first issues we faced was that our Deployment 3.1 wasnâ€™t deploying properly via Jenkins. This required us to rollback the application to an older version for troubleshooting.

## Steps

1. **Initial Build Issue**
    - Encountered "500 Internal Server Error"

2. **Rollback Steps**
    ```
    cd into our github repo via the command line
    cd deploy3.1
    cd c4_deployment-3.1
    git log --pretty=oneline
    git checkout 4eaf0baefef7d59bd6608711cfecc7fdfc030461 
    git add .
    git commit -m "Version 1 restored"
    git push
    git pull origin main
    git config pull.rebase false
    git status
    ```

3. **Resolving Test Phase Issue**
    - Update `test_app.py` as needed

## Replace Test Code Snippet in Python

Here is a Python test code snippet from our application.

```python
from application import app, greet

def test_quick():
  a = "jeff"
  greeting = greet(a)

4. **Final Deployment**
    - URL Shortener is now working again.

## Optimization

**Problem Location**

- The issue originates at Line 20 with a discrepancy of one letter.

**Suggested Actions**

- Investigate the discrepancy and apply a fix in the next version.
